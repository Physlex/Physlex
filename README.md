    <br />
      <p>
     Hello, I am Alexander Williams-Letondre. I am considered a novice in programming but every day I spend most of my time learning as much as I can about the areas I am interested in. Currently, I am mainly interested in game development and good documentation / planning practice. My current hope is to become employable as a junior software engineer or game developer in a well managed business. Eventually, I hope to become an Expert Machine learning developer.
    <br />
    <br />
      - I’m interested in Video game development, data science, machine learning, agile method development and composition style programming! (That may seem like a lot, but from where I stand, if it wasn't for a lack of time, the list would be far longer)
    <br />
    <br />
    - I’m currently learning these Basic Computer Science Concepts: UML design flow, Agile methedology, Discrete Mathematics.
    <br >
    <br />
    - I am also currently learning the Unreal Engine for personal projects. This includes exterior software for game development such as blender and python (For plugins).
    <br />
    <br />
    - Currently learning these game development methods: UMG, Blender workflow, ue4 Plugin creation, level blockouts, character physics.
    <br />
    <br />
    - Currently, UE4 is taking most of my time. Currently I am learning how to make repositories using source control through visual studio and git (thus also github). For the time being, since I can only link and hope that you can read my achievements list in ue4, I will state that my ue4 online learning account consists of 22 achievements. This constitutes a point score of 1461. I spend approximately 6-8 hours on learning game dev from monday to friday, meaning that my current hours spent on learning is ~approx 200 hours. (Updated weekly)
    <br />
    <br />
      - If you feel confident that I am the right fit for your project || company, please reach out to me. Currently, I have no work in my hometown due to covid. I have only the most basic skills with the ue4 engine and blender, but I have spent all of my time getting comfortable with the engine itself, so that is not to be unexpected. Thus, if you want some cheap junior dev labor, I can give that a go as long as you are willing to answer some questions here and there.
    <br />
    <br />
       - I’m looking to collaborate on: Game development regarding Unreal Engine 4, Helping a fellow developer solve any complicated problems and above all else, anything that gives me a chance to talk to people! I miss talking to people... Haha!

    <h3>Currently Understood Concepts: </h3>
    <ul>
      <p>(Con means I understand the theory side of it and havent found a way to implement it that makes full use of the thing, Imp means I understand the basic implementation of the thing.)
      <li>
        Data structures (Linked List(Imp), Doubly Linked List(Con), Map(Imp), Graph(Con), Tree(Con), Stack(Con), Queue(Con), Deque(Con))
      </li>
      <li>
        Discrete mathmatics (Sets(Con), Truth Tables(Con), Boolean Logic(Con || Imp))
      </li>
      <li>
        Intermediate level C++ (Linker Nonsense, Smart Pointers, Function Pointers, C++ Styled Composition)
      </li>
      <li> 
        Composition Style OOP (Has a rather than Is a, when to use inheritance, philosophy behind design structures, multi-project programming implementation)
      </li>
      <li> 
        Advanced Concepts relating to storage of data. My most proud program to this date is a FSM used to control a player entity. No tutorial, Self-Built.
      </li>
    </ul>

The best this is used for is whether I understand syntax.)

        <a href="https://learn.unrealengine.com/achievements" target="_blank"> My Unreal Engine achievements page.</a> No idea if this is observable to others. (This is a much, much better representation of my understanding, along with soon-to-be made itch.io games that will be published as side projects)
