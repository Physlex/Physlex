# Alexander Williams-Letondre
## Software Engineer (Firmware to Full-Stack)

Hi! I’m Alex, a software engineer with a diverse background in firmware and full-stack application development. I have around a year of professional experience from my capstone at the University of Alberta and an internship at Hubbell Incorporated, both of which are private projects and not open-source.

I enjoy tinkering and typically have several projects on the go. Notably, I have a personal website with a separate backend and a League of Legends API project exploring Django integration.

One of my major endeavors is a programming language called Pulse, currently in the research stage. I'm building it to be statically compiled, with plans to create a lexer and parser from scratch. This will integrate into a larger project, Wav2Mov, initially an audio-video converter that has evolved into a more complex project utilizing FFmpeg and Pulse.

I’ve also participated in hackathons, with my next one being natHACK 2024, where I aim to develop a solution for processing and synchronizing dream data into video using AI, employing the ESP32 microcontroller, LoRa, and FreeRTOS.

## Previous Projects

- [proGRESS](https://github.com/Physlex/GetNatHackedBud) is a secure, low-cost alternative to a digital workout machine. It uses an RFID system for profile validation and an accelerometer to track workout repititions.
- [Job-Tracker](https://github.com/401-hackathon-2024/job-tracker) a google chrome application that would generate a resume based on some profile data which then auto-fills fields on job application websites.
- [Function-Approximation](https://github.com/Physlex/InterpolationAndApproximation) an adapted lab from a course in university which I think is kind of neat. Approximates functions using polynomial regression techniques. At some point I accidentally re-invented the FFT algorithm since I though the trigonometric interpolation technique was related to the FFT. I was incorrect, but it was still cool.
- [Project-Nihility](https://github.com/Physlex/ProjectNihility) The first attempt at Nihility. We have since decided to migrate to the Godot engine due to concerns of UE5's lacking documentation for modifying the engine.
