- 👋 Hi, I’m @Physlex
- 👀 I’m interested in c++, engine creation, bug hunting, game development, you name it and I have probably wanted to do it for a bit now.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: c++, engine creation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: Anything newbie friendly! Any excuse to read c++ is a big plus for me! I can do translation work as well in japanese, though kanji is a big no-no!
- 📫 How to reach me: thepurplpanda4@gmail.com, though considering this is a place of programmers I might make a new email to avoid... complications.
