- 👋 Hi, I’m @Physlex or Alexander Willet, you can call me either.
</p>

- 👀 I’m interested in c++, 2d Arrays, program automation, saving data via a file system, organization, you name it and I have probably wanted to do it for a bit now.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning: c++, HTML
-     I will soon be learning: Javascript, c#, website design, css, python.
     
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: Anything newbie friendly! Any excuse to read c++ or HTML is a big advantage.

- 📫 How to reach me: thepurplpanda4@gmail.com, though considering this is a place of programmers I might make a new email to avoid... complications.
