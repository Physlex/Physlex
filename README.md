## Software Engineer (Firmware to Full-Stack)

Hi! Iâ€™m Alex, a software engineer with a diverse background in firmware and full-stack application development. I have around a year of professional experience from my capstone at the University of Alberta and an internship at Hubbell Incorporated, both of which are private products and not open-source. (Feel free to ask me about them though, and I will disclose anything non-NDA!).

I enjoy tinkering and typically have several projects on the go. Notably, I have a motor controller IoT device being worked on planned for completion this summer, as well as a rocket telemetry project made in cooperation of [UASTARR](https://www.uastarr.ca/).

Most of my (public, typically completed) projects listed below are hackathons or the results of a couple of days of work on a specific core subject. They are explained in more detail next to their associated links. They are representitive of my breadth of knowledge, but due to time constraints they often do not sufficiently represent my depth of knowledge in a particular domain. My university does not allow display of school "projects" as resume material unless explicitly mentioned, and I don't view university as a particularly good representation of software development in general, nonetheless my capabilities, so let it be known that the only projects from university are those that caused me to be so independent from the core idea that I felt sufficient to post as my own in place of the original academic project.

Due to university, I often have less time free to myself than I would when working, so I expect the number of projects, or the level of expertise required to develop them, to increase post-grad in april of 2025. I plan at that point to create blogs once a month on the more interesting aspects of work for that period. 

Finally, one fun fact about myself, I'm a massive proponent of Type-Oriented programming! I was introduced to it via my internship at Hubbell (where I built a type-specified hardware abstraction layer using tools like finite typestate machines). If interested, I highly recommend reading the paper: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/papers/onward2009-state.pdf

## Previous Projects
- [Music Genre Classifier](https://github.com/Physlex/music_genre_classifier) a simple 3-model experiment with included feature extraction of the GTZAN dataset using librosa. Kinda neat, proves I know the basics of AI, for anyone curious
- [proGRESS](https://github.com/Physlex/GetNatHackedBud) is a secure, low-cost alternative to a digital workout machine. It uses an RFID system for profile validation and an accelerometer to track workout repititions.
- [Job-Tracker](https://github.com/401-hackathon-2024/job-tracker) a google chrome application that would generate a resume based on some profile data which then auto-fills fields on job application websites.
- [Function-Approximation](https://github.com/Physlex/InterpolationAndApproximation) an adapted lab from a course in university which I think is kind of neat. Approximates functions using polynomial regression techniques. At some point I accidentally re-invented the FFT algorithm since I though the trigonometric interpolation technique was related to the FFT. I was incorrect, but it was still cool.
- [Project-Nihility](https://github.com/Physlex/ProjectNihility) The first attempt at Nihility. We have since decided to migrate to the Godot engine due to concerns of UE5's lacking documentation for modifying the engine.
- [natHACK 2024](https://github.com/Physlex/natHACK2024) An overly ambitious project for a two day hackathon, haha. It's an eeg -> image -> video transformer. We used two concatenated AI models to re-generate the video a user watched by reconstructing it using their brain data.
