    <br />
      <p>
     Hello, I am Alexander Williams-Letondre. I am considered a novice in programming but every day I spend most of my time learning as much as I can about the areas I am interested in. Currently, I am mainly interested in making my coding readable to allow myself and my teammates the ability to make scale-able code. My current hope is to become employable as a junior engineer in either software engineering / simulations or game development. Eventually, I hope to become an Expert Machine learning developer.
    <br />
    <br />
      - I’m interested in Video game development, data science, machine learning, agile method development and composition style programming! (That may seem like a lot, but from where I stand, if it wasn't for a lack of time, the list would be far longer)
    <br />
    <br />
      - I’m currently learning: Intermediate level Programming Concepts (UML design flow, Agile methedology, Discrete Mathematics, Multi-System programs.)
    <br />
    <br />
       - I will soon be learning: Unreal Engine, Python, QT, Boost Library.
    <br />
    <br />
       - I’m looking to collaborate on: any C++ programs. Any excuse to read C++ or professionally designed code is welcome.

    <h3>Currently Understood Concepts: </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Basic Data structures (Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Map)
      </li>
      <li>
        Intermediate level C++ (Linker Nonsense, Pointers, function pointers, C++ Styled Composition)
      </li>
      <li> 
        Composition Style OOP (Has a rather than Is a, friend keyword and best practice regarding that)
      </li>
      <li> 
        Advanced Concepts relating to storage of data. My most proud program to this date is a FSM used to control a player entity. No tutorial, Self-Built.

The best this is used for is whether I understand syntax.)
