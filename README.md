# Intro
I am a soon to be graduating student of the University of Alberta in his 4th year of studies of Computing Science. I like to build low-level, server-oriented, and otherwise systems-side materials. Currently employed as an intern for Summer 2024 by Hubbell Wildlife mitigation services to assist in the development of RTOS systems on the STM32 series of microcontrollers. My typical interests are in software design, computer graphics, and systems optimization.

### Current Projects:
* Nihility
  - Private project. Code avaliable to employers on request. (and eventually when released). Visual novel adventure game built in UE5. Student lead, student designed, student implemented.
* Nathack 2023
  - Private untill submitted. Top secret. Web app but brain stuffs. Big hush.
* Interpolation project
  - Currently private. Adapted off of a school project, since I had the time and wanted to tinker with the idea a little more. Will be released publically when it can't be used for plagarism due to differences.
* From when I attended [a scientific hackathon to prototype new technology](https://github.com/Physlex/OctoSporkNatHack2022)
  - My first actual usage of javascript. Main priority was hooking up bluetooth to a server to a brainwave scanner. Was kinda neat.
